Shotokhan: I modified this to have a shared object for accessing memory-mapped files, like ```/dev/shm``` sub-tree, to emulate arbitrary read&write in a VM from a compromised hypervisor. The shared object is then used in Python with CDLL. Use ```make shared``` to build the shared object, or ```make all``` for the command-line utility, which I also modified.
